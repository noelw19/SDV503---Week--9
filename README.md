//Number.isFinite() - you can use this to determine whether a number is a finite number, it examines th number in its argument, if its NaN , positive or negative infinity it will return false, otherwise it will output true.

//number.isInteger() - determines whether a value that has been passed is an integer.

toFixed() - used to define a decimal point position for all future outputs.
toLocalString()
